# Surgical Smoke Research Data Input
A local hospital was conducting reseach on smoke generated in the operating rooms and had over 400 paper sheets filled out by workers in the OR. Inputing each one by hand was very time consuming so I created a Python GUI with TkInter to replicate the paper to reduce input time by over 50%.

The GUI sheet is linked with a MySQL database to hold all the data. Clicking the 'Submit' button adds a new record to the database and clears all form fields.
